## 📌 Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing **drug effectiveness** using **AI and machine learning techniques**.  
By leveraging patient data, we aim to make a machine learning model to predict which diabetic patients are most likely to return to the hospital. 
By identifying high-risk individuals, healthcare providers can take timely action to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and improve patient care. 
Looking ahead, integrating more detailed clinical information and implementing real-time predictions could further enhance the impact and effectiveness of this approach.
