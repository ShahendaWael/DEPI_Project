## 📌 Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting hospital readmission among diabetic patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient demographics, lab results, medication details, and clinical visits, we aim to identify key factors contributing to readmission and build an effective predictive model.
**The main objectives were to:**
- Clean and preprocess real-world healthcare data.
- Explore and visualize relationships between clinical features and readmission outcomes.
- Select relevant features based on clinical insight and statistical correlation.
- Train and evaluate multiple classifiers including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and XGBoost.
- Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
- Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
The final model helps hospitals anticipate potential readmissions and supports better treatment planning to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.
